This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and
include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

Loading and preprocessing the data
----------------------------------

Unzip the file "activity.zip" and read the data file "activity.csv".

    activdat <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip","activity.csv"))

Now take a look at what we're dealing with so we know how best to clean.

    summary(activdat)

    ##      steps                date          interval     
    ##  Min.   :  0.00   2012-10-01:  288   Min.   :   0.0  
    ##  1st Qu.:  0.00   2012-10-02:  288   1st Qu.: 588.8  
    ##  Median :  0.00   2012-10-03:  288   Median :1177.5  
    ##  Mean   : 37.38   2012-10-04:  288   Mean   :1177.5  
    ##  3rd Qu.: 12.00   2012-10-05:  288   3rd Qu.:1766.2  
    ##  Max.   :806.00   2012-10-06:  288   Max.   :2355.0  
    ##  NA's   :2304     (Other)   :15840

    str(activdat)

    ## 'data.frame':    17568 obs. of  3 variables:
    ##  $ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
    ##  $ date    : Factor w/ 61 levels "2012-10-01","2012-10-02",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
    ##  $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...

So we see 17568 observations of 3 variables in the dataset with 2304 NAs
in the **steps** column and the **interval** values appear as a varied
length integer representing minutes (and generally hours) after
midnight. For ease of further analysis we will clean the data set by
converting the **interval** column to a **time** character variable and
combine with the **date** variable to form a new variable **datetime**
which will be compared with **steps**.

    library(lubridate)
    library(dplyr)

    activdat$time <- sprintf("%04d",activdat$interval) 
    activdat$time <- activdat$time %>%
            sub("([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})","\\1:\\2",.,perl=TRUE)
    activdat$datetime <- activdat$time %>% 
        paste(activdat$date,.,sep=" ") %>% ymd_hm
    data <-select(activdat, time, datetime, steps)
    summary(data)

    ##      time              datetime                       steps

    ##                     Max.   :2012-11-30 23:55:00   Max.   :806.00  
    ##                                                   NA's   :2304

What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?
-----------------------------------------------------

We'll initially assume that NA values can be ignored for this part.

    dailysteptotals <- tapply(data$steps,date(data$datetime),sum,na.rm=TRUE)
    range(dailysteptotals)

    ## [1]     0 21194

We see the values for **dailysteptotals** lie between 0 and 22000 so
when creating a histogram we'll use 22 breaks (one for every 1000
steps).

    hist(dailysteptotals, breaks = 22, col = "blue", xlab = "Total steps per day", main = "Histogram of Daily Step Totals")

![](PA1_template_files/figure-markdown_strict/histogram%20of%20daily%20totals-1.png)

From the histogram we can see that there are 10 days with an unusuallly
low (&lt;1000) total daily steps but is this due to low values or a
result of NAs being removed? If from the earlier summary we note that
there are 2304 NAs in the dataset and each day has 288 readings, we can
check the distribution of the NAs:

    nas <- tapply(data$steps,date(data$datetime),function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
    # how many days have all NA values?
    sum(nas %in% 288)

    ## [1] 8

    # how many days have between 0 and 288 NA values?
    sum(nas > 0 & nas < 288)

    ## [1] 0

So we see that there are 8 days where all values are NA and no days
where some values are NA. This suggests that these 8 "NA" days should be
discounted from the dataset when determining medians, means, etc. giving
the resulting histogram and values:

    baddays <- nas==288
    hist(dailysteptotals[!baddays], breaks = 22, col = "blue", xlab = "Total steps per day", main = "Histogram of Daily Step Totals")

![](PA1_template_files/figure-markdown_strict/updated%20histogram-1.png)

    mn <- mean(dailysteptotals[!baddays])
    mn

    ## [1] 10766.19

    md <- median(dailysteptotals[!baddays])
    md

    ## [1] 10765

This shows us the actual mean to be 10766.19 steps and the actual median
of the total recorded steps per day to be 10765 steps.

What is the average daily activity pattern?
-------------------------------------------

We'll group the **steps** by the **time** interval and calculate the
means, removing any NA values.

    perday <- tapply(data$steps, data$time, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    highest <- data$time[1:288][perday==max(perday)]
    plot(as.POSIXct(data$datetime, format = "%H:%M")[1:288] , perday, type = "l", main = "Time Series of Average Steps Taken per Interval", ylab= "Average steps per 5 minutes", xlab = "Time of the Day", xaxs='r')
    points(as.POSIXct(data$datetime, format = "%H:%M")[1:288][perday==max(perday)], max(perday), pch=19, col="red")

![](PA1_template_files/figure-markdown_strict/time%20series-1.png)

From the time series we can see that the **interval** with the highest
number of **steps** begins at 08:35 with a value of 206.17 steps.

Imputing missing values
-----------------------

From our earlier observation of the NA values we found the total number
of NAs came from 8 days of missing data:

    missingdates <- unique(date(data$datetime))[nas %in% 288]
    missingdates

    ## [1] "2012-10-01" "2012-10-08" "2012-11-01" "2012-11-04" "2012-11-09"
    ## [6] "2012-11-10" "2012-11-14" "2012-11-30"

    weekdays(missingdates)

    ## [1] "Monday"    "Monday"    "Thursday"  "Sunday"    "Friday"    "Saturday" 
    ## [7] "Wednesday" "Friday"

Multiplying the 8 days by the 288 observations per day gives us the 2304
NA values that were described in the initial summary of the
**activity.csv** table. We will look to impute these missing values by
replacing with averages for each interval based on the weekday. Note
that Tuesdays have no missing values so will not be calculated.

    data$day <- weekdays(data$datetime)
    mondat <- tapply(data$steps[data$day=="Monday"], data$time[data$day=="Monday"], mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    weddat <- tapply(data$steps[data$day=="Wednesday"], data$time[data$day=="Wednesday"], mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    thudat <- tapply(data$steps[data$day=="Thursday"], data$time[data$day=="Thursday"], mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    fridat <- tapply(data$steps[data$day=="Friday"], data$time[data$day=="Friday"], mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    satdat <- tapply(data$steps[data$day=="Saturday"], data$time[data$day=="Saturday"], mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    sundat <- tapply(data$steps[data$day=="Sunday"], data$time[data$day=="Sunday"], mean, na.rm=TRUE)
    newdata <- data
    newdata$steps[date(data$datetime)=="2012-10-01"|date(data$datetime)=="2012-10-08"]<-mondat
    newdata$steps[date(data$datetime)=="2012-11-01"]<-thudat 
    newdata$steps[date(data$datetime)=="2012-11-04"]<-sundat
    newdata$steps[date(data$datetime)=="2012-11-09"|date(data$datetime)=="2012-11-30"]<-fridat
    newdata$steps[date(data$datetime)=="2012-11-10"]<-satdat
    newdata$steps[date(data$datetime)=="2012-11-14"]<-weddat
    sum(is.na(newdata$steps))

    ## [1] 0

So there are now no NA values in the **newdata** dataset. Let's look at
the changes to the histogram, mean, and median of daily step totals, now
that the missing values have been replaced with imputed values.

    dailysteptotals2 <- tapply(newdata$steps,date(newdata$datetime),sum)
    hist(dailysteptotals2, breaks = 22, col = "lightblue", xlab = "Total steps per day", main = "Histogram with Imputed values compared with Original")
    hist(dailysteptotals[!baddays], breaks = 22, col = "blue", add=TRUE)
    legend("topright",c("Original", "Updated"), fill = c("blue","lightblue"))

![](PA1_template_files/figure-markdown_strict/new%20histogram-1.png)

    # Calculate the new mean and compare with the old mean
    mn2 <- mean(dailysteptotals2)
    mn2-mn

    ## [1] 55.02092

    # Calculate the new median and compare with the old median
    md2 <- median(dailysteptotals2)
    md2-md

    ## [1] 250

So the mean of the **newdata** daily step totals is 10821.21, which is
55.02 steps higher than the original mean and the median is now 11015,
which is 250 steps higher than the original data. So the effect of
imputing values was quite significant on the daily total distribution as
it gave weight to days that would either be lumped into the lowest bin
(if you discounted NA values but still took the sums for the day (see
first histogram)) or would not contribute at all (if you only
represented recorded data as in the second histogram). Though on the
grand scale of the data you can see that it only counts for a 0.51%
change in the mean.

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will allocate the **daytype** variable to determine whether an
observation occurs on a weekday or on the weekend then aggregate the
means for each interval separately for each **daytype** value. As the
time intervals are continuous and circular, we will repeat the first
value of each subset and allocate to 24:00 so that the span of the data
includes the full 24hr period (lines are between two points so you need
to create the line between 23:55 and 00:00/24:00 to encompass the full
day).

    # Create variable for day type
    newdata$daytype[newdata$day=="Saturday"|newdata$day=="Sunday"] <- "weekend"
    newdata$daytype[!newdata$day=="Saturday" & !newdata$day=="Sunday"] <- "weekday"
    # Find mean steps per interval by daytype
    wkd <- filter(newdata, daytype=="weekday")
    wkend <- filter(newdata, daytype=="weekend")
    perwkd <- tapply(wkd$steps, wkd$time, mean)
    perwkend <- tapply(wkend$steps, wkend$time, mean)
    # Create dataset to allow smooth plotting of the timeseries data
    plotdat <- data.frame(time=rep(c(activdat$interval[1:288],2400),2),steps=c(perwkd,perwkd[[1]],perwkend,perwkend[[1]]), type=c(rep("Weekday",289),rep("Weekend",289)))
    library(lattice)
    p <- xyplot(steps ~ time | as.factor(type), data = plotdat, type = "l", layout = c(1,2), main="Time Series of Average Steps per Time Interval", xlab = "Time of the Day", ylab = "Number of Steps Taken", xlim=c(0,2400), scales = list(x=list(at=c(0,400,800,1200,1600,2000,2400),labels=c("00:00","04:00","08:00","12:00","16:00","20:00","24:00"))))
    print(p)

![](PA1_template_files/figure-markdown_strict/weekday-1.png)

From the plots we can see that weekday activity starts around the 5am
mark whilst on the weekend it doesn't begin until around 7:30am.
Weekdays also show a major spike from 8-9am followed by some minor
spikes (~50-100 steps) around midday, 3:30pm, 5pm and 6:30pm. Weekends
on the otherhand have a smaller maximum but seem to be more active
(~50-150 steps) for a longer period. This could suggest that the
participant works/studies Monday-Friday in a position that is primarily
sedentary, increasing activity only for lunch, afternoon tea, home time,
and dinner, though is relatively consistently mobile on weekends from
about 7:30am until about 9:00pm.
